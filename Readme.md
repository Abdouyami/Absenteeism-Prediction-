# 🚀 Absenteeism Prediction at Work  

## 📋 Project Overview  
This project aims to predict employee absenteeism during work hours using machine learning techniques. The ability to foresee absenteeism allows organizations to make better-informed decisions, reorganize work processes, and maintain productivity.  

## ❓ Problem Statement  
Absenteeism, defined as "the absence from work during normal working hours resulting in temporary incapacity to execute regular work activity," is a common challenge for businesses. Understanding the patterns and factors that contribute to absenteeism can improve decision-making and resource allocation, thereby reducing the negative impact on productivity.  

### 🎯 Business Objective  
The objective is to determine whether an employee, based on specific characteristics (e.g., distance from the workplace, education level, family structure), is likely to be absent and for how many hours.  

## 📊 Dataset  
The dataset used in this project is derived from an existing study on absenteeism prediction. This is a **secondary dataset**, meaning it was collected and prepared by a third party.  

### 🔧 Data Preprocessing  
The raw dataset underwent preprocessing to address common data issues, such as:  
- ⚠️ Handling missing or inconsistent values.  
- 🛠 Standardizing data formats.  
- 🧹 Preparing the data for statistical analysis and machine learning.  

## 🧠 Methodology  
1. **🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand the data structure and identify key patterns.  
2. **🛠 Feature Engineering:** Select and transform relevant features to improve model performance.  
3. **🤖 Model Building:** Develop and train a predictive model using **logistic regression** from **scikit-learn**.  
4. **📏 Evaluation:** Validate the model using appropriate metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability.  
5. **📈 Data Visualization:** Present results and insights using **Tableau** for clarity and business impact.  

## 🛠 Key Features and Tools  
- 🐍 **Python** for data analysis and machine learning.  
- ⚙️ **scikit-learn** for logistic regression and predictive modeling.  
- 📊 **NumPy** and **pandas** for data manipulation and analysis.  
- 🌐 **Tableau** for interactive data visualization.
